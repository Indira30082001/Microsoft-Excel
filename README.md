My Learning Journey

Hello!

I've recently embarked on an exciting journey to learn data science from scratch. With no prior experience, I'm diving headfirst into the world of data, algorithms, and analytics to build a strong foundation.

Why Microsoft?

To guide my learning, I've chosen to follow Microsoft courses. Their structured and comprehensive resources make it easier to grasp complex concepts, and their focus on practical skills ensures I'm learning what the industry values.

Hands-On Projects

Theory is essential, but nothing beats learning by doing. As part of my journey, I'm actively working on projects to apply what I learn in real-world scenarios. These projects will not only help solidify my understanding but also build a portfolio to showcase my skills.

What's Next?

I'll continue to explore more advanced topics, take on challenging projects, and eventually aim for certifications to validate my skills. This README will be updated as I progress, sharing milestones and key learnings along the way.
